- the 1000 necessary administration functions
-- password refreshing (not possible to bring your own password) (admins can only refresh their own passwords)
-- password recovery factor (admins have email addresses on record, instructed to email a global admin?)
-- adding and removing board-specific admins (limited to global admins)
-- adding and removing global admins (limited to global admins) (root admin, i.e. the admin with the name "admin", cannot be removed, and admins cannot remove themselves)
-- proper post content history for admins/mods to review (IMMUTABLE!!!)

- reporting, filtering reports by sender ip, hiding reports from ips/ip ranges (basically soft-banning people from making reports)
- board and thread names in head tag's title tag
- some kind of tripcode system
- IDs (board-level setting, on by default, refreshes when the thread cycles over)

!!! - preban public botnets and known sources of spam
!!! - DATABASE SERIALIZATION AND DESERIALIZATION!!!

post-release:

- board catalogs
- ban explanation
- temporary bans
- give banned users a cookie that doesn't prevent them from posting but does track their posting events. show moderators when a post was from someone who is probably evading a ban. make sure it does not display if they were manually unbanned.
- finish migrating to templates
- load templates from files
- remove all usages of unwrap()
- replace get_mut() with get() where possible
